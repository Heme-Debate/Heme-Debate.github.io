      <description>RStudio is an incredibly useful tool for data analysis and seems to be such a powerhouse in the field of science. Virtually anytime I talk with other scientists about their work or converse over other papers, it someone comes up that the data analysis was performed in R! This makes sense, as it’s a really intuitive, user-friendly interface. After working with it for a total of a year now (woah; 25% of my college career was spent with my little pal, R &amp;lt;3), it seemed to be very much its own thing.</description>

And away we go! Loading stuff up. This is data was obtained from Kraggle and is essentially a breakdown of the Melbourne housing market, which has ‘cooled down’ recently. I had a few other ideas in mind before this one, such as pitching in professional baseball, but it turns out sometimes there can actually be too much data: something I had never considered. But, this dataset is really nice!</description>
